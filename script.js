// just reviewing values
// nice to get back to the basics to master React
// you can store values in variables to use them over and over again

// this is declaring a variable
// it stores that value inside that variable

// you can change a variable name once and it will change in all places used
// without variables you would have to change it everywhere

// camelCase is a naming convention

//let 3years = 3; this is an invalid or unexpected error token due to the name of the variable
// marcus&see = 'ms'; this also doesn't work due to the & sign
// let new = 27; this doesn't work because new is a reserved key word
// let function = 56; this will not work but $function will
// let Person = 'Steven'; another naming convention-all names should start lower case
let PI = 3.135; 

// REMEMBER TO WRITE YOUR VARIABLE NAMES IN A DESCRIPTIVE WAY
let myFirstJob = 'Recreational Aide';
let myCurrentJob = 'Developer';
// the above example makes more descriptive
let job1 = 'rec aide';
let job2 = 'developer';

console.log(myCurrentJob);
